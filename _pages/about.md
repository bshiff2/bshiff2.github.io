This website was created using GitHub Pages with Jekyll, and is based on the Academic Pages template: https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io

This page contains information about me, my skills, my interests, etc.
Above is the navigation bar, which can take you to my Resume for a more complete collection of information about me, as well as my Portfolio of github projects.

Bio
======
My name is Bryce Shifflett, I'm currently an undergraduate at Louisiana State Univeristy in my junior year. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a concentration on Cybersecurity. Growing up, I've always been fasinated by the world of technology, and since middle school I've been taking STEM and Computer Science classes to satisify my thirst for knowledge on the subject. I've taken this drive to college, where I seek to further my education and practice my skills. I seek to continue this outside of college and after I graduate, searching for interships and other opportunities to learn more not just about Computer Science or Cybersecurity, but essential life skills as well.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
