For the current Fall semester of 2025, I and a team of 4 others began developing Dinnr, a mobile app 
that integrated OpenAI's GPT-4o mini LLM to assist users in discovering restaurants and engage in
conversations. The app was developed using Flutter, with the code being done in Dart, and besides
the LLM also utilized Google Places API for resturant data and Firebase for user authentication and
to hold user data. The project includes login, a chat page for the AI with the option to choose 
between different personalities, a restaurant discovery page, and user profile management. I contributed
to the frontend of the home page, chat page, and profile page, as well as the UI and funcionality for
user input and navigation.<br/> 
This project is still currently ongoing.<br/><br/>
