During the Spring semester of 2025, I worked in a team of 5 in a semester long project to develop a website that hosted a series of games, similar to the New York Times Games. The porject was developed in Flutter, using Dart for the frontend and backend components, and utalized a SQLite database that contained user information, such as email, scores for the games, etc. The game featured a login system, 3 seperate games, and a working leaderboard for each game. During the project, we followed Agile methodology and the Scrum framework for development. I contributed the frontend of the leaderboard pages, backend logic for the games, as well as serving as the team's QA tester.
